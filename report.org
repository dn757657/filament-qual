* Intent
- observe x and y planar dimensional accuracy of cavernaPP filament
- observe bed adhesion with recommended caverna default

* Observations
- adhered to bed with default setting
- post precessing caused warping in samples, likely not problematic
- dimensional accuracy within 10% (perhaps trivial due to not following post processing standard)

* Conclusion
- need to access correct post processing to observe results as manufacturer intended
- using recommended settings yeilds sucessful prints
- not sure if experimenting with temperature related params is warranted since physical properties are not 

* Next
- move onto shape 002 in upright pos
- print speed could be optimized
- layer height could be experimented with
- nozzle temp could be optimized, as low as possible without affecting physical paramsx
