* Intent
- observe dimensional accuracy and layer adhesion behavior using recommended caverna printing profile
- observe printing without infill
- begin understanding of caverna post processing

* Observations
- print failed
- some layers completed, but evidence of issues with first layer indicate adhesion issues in all layers
- very poor print quality before total failure
- parts flexing significantly while printing, print head seemingly dragging parts as it prints
- eventual complete delamination from bed

* Conclusion
- adhesion issues leading to total print failure

* Next
- provide some sort of first layer assistance, aka brim, raft, etc
- bed temp is maxed so cannot increase
- lower print speed
