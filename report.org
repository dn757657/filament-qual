* Intent
- observe dimensional accuracy and layer adhesion behavior using recommended caverna printing profile
- observe printing without infill
- begin understanding of caverna post processing

* Methodology
- export gcode using default cavnera printing config file and shape_001
- print shape_001 thin cylinder (primarily observe dimensional accuracy in x and y directions)

* Observations
- NA

* Conclusion
- NA

* Next
- print basic shape using default settings, observe dimensional accuracy
