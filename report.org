* Intent
- observe dimensional accuracy and layer adhesion using minimum recommended settings (by manu.) as baseline

* Observations
- print failed to adhere to bed
- did not complete first layer

* Conclusion
- print failed to adhere to bed

* Next
- increse bed temperature for better adhesion properties
- add raft/brim
