* Intent
- define low bound of bed temp given low bound of extrusion of 200

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config)
- plate parts as desired
- gcode exported for eahc bed temp ranging from 20 to 60C in ten deg increments (20-40 recommended)
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations
- edge curling in all samples

* Conclusion
- 200 degree minimum extrusion temp is not suitable

* Next
- print at various bed temps and extrusion temps to find low bound of both
