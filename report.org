* Intent
- updates to repo structure and developping main and branch file structure
  
** File Struct
- each branch should contian
  1. a version of this report file
  2. an .stl part file used in testing - will also be tracked via shapes repo
  3. a settings file for print settings
  4. numerical data as needed in suitable/acessible file types
  5. config.ini file for slicer settings/config
  6. gcode file used in branch test
- important to note that each branch commit shoudl contain only ONE of the notes files other than potentially results file(s)

** Branching
- new branches will be defined when either
  - test component changes
  - a new printing parameter is manipulated/explored
  - a new filament is explored (always rebase to first commit/master branch)

** Shapes
- shapes will be tracked/controlled in seperate repo
- preferably note the intent of each shape, or intended exploit/observation/purpose of the shape in commit

* Observations
- critical observations

* Conclusion
- critical outcomes of the branch

* Next
- possible progression for next branches
