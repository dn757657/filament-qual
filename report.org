* Intent
- observe baseline behaviors in PLA for shape 001
- using base PLA profile for prusa PLA
- using base prusa slicer profile for MK3S+ printer

* Observations
- print successful
- dispersed seam is visible throughout (where extruder completes outer perimeter and walks into inner perimeter) as small indent
- slight over extrusion of outer diameter @ 10.275 mm 10.275/10 = 102.75%
- first few layers underextruded
- overextrusion causing smaller inner diam = 6.870 bottom, 6.638 top (worsens as print progresses?)
- surface issue noticable every mm or so, single layer protrudes slightly

* Conclusion
- printing is of reasonable quality given that no slicer corrections or advanced features are applied

* Next
- apply elephant foot compensation/recommended first layer corrections (prusa defaults)
- adjust extrusion scaling factor for better dimensional accuracy
