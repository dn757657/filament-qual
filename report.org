* Intent
- observe x and y planar behavior by using a shape with single layer in z axis
- observe qualitative strength of part both along and across printed lines
- observe dimensional accuracy both along and across extruded lines
- observe bed adhesion at min acheiveable bed temps for smaller components (20x20mm v11)

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config)
- plate parts as desired (three smaples for observing consistency)
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations
- critical observations

* Conclusion
- critical outcomes of the branch

* Next
- possible progression for next branches
