* Intent
- establish base config file for varioshore TPU
- starting with lowest of any recommended settings as baseline
- bed temp baseline set to 25 instead of minimum 20 as lab space may be above 20 (as has been observed)
- no cooling for max adhesion
- extrusion multiplier left at 1

* Observations
- critical observations

* Conclusion
- critical outcomes of the branch

* Next
- possible progression for next branches
