* Intent
- continue to observe x and y dimensional behavior
- observe bed adhesion at different extrusion temperatures

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config, single layer)
  - added extruders for different nozzle temps of each part, better way to do??
- plate parts as desired, 6 samples each in increments of 10 degC starting at 200C->260, as we know 190 doesnt work at current master branch or default bed temp which is recommended min
- note that increments go over recommeneded max, this is intentional
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations

* Conclusion

* Next
- skirt, has trouble sticking due to nozzle oozing and buildup
