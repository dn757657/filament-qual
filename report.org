* Intent
- get lower bounded relationship of extrusion temp and bed temp where adhesion is reliable

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config)
- plate parts as desired
- 5 parts for extrusion temps 210-250 (as 200 was observed as non functional aat all bed temps previously)
- gcode exported for each bed temp (10 C increments from 30-60), extrusion temp for each sample modified in g code
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations
  
* Conclusion

* Next
