* Intent
- continue to observe x and y dimensional behavior
- observe bed adhesion at different extrusion temperatures

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config, single layer)
  - added extruders for different nozzle temps of each part, better way to do??
- plate parts as desired, 6 samples each in increments of 10 degC starting at 200C, as we know 190 doesnt work at current master branch or default bed temp which is recommended min
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations
- g code did not wtich nozzle temps as desired, need to investigate
- first sample printed but edges where nozzle turns around lifted, possibly due to low bed temp
- little to no xy planar adhesion normal to extrusion
- part if very strong along axial of extrusion
- felxible
- slightly underextruded

* Conclusion
- bed temps likely too low, investigate g code nozzle temp switching between parts
- 200C is lower limit of extrusion temp
  
* Next
- perhaps rerun with proper g code, determine best of the run or upper bound and move to bed temp increases
- elevated bed temp beneficial
