* Intent
- initial commit outlining repo structure and file structures
  
** File Struct
- each branch should contian
  1. a version of this report file
  2. an .stl part file used in testing
  3. a settings file for print settings
  4. numerical data as needed in suitable/acessible file types

** Branching
- new branches will be defined when either
  - test component changes
  - a new printing parameter is manipulated/explored
  - a new filament is explored (always rebase to first commit/master branch)

* Observations
- critical observations

* Conclusion
- critical outcomes of the branch

* Next
- possible progression for next branches
