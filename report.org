* Intent
- observe x and y planar behavior by using a shape with single layer in z axis
- observe qualitative strength of part both along and across printed lines
- observe dimensional accuracy both along and across extruded lines
- observe bed adhesion at min acheiveable bed temps for smaller components (20x20mm v11)
- find lower bound of nozzle temp & bed temp where adhesion is ok

* Procedure
- export latest part from shapes library to .stl corresponding to branch
- import stl to slicer
- import slicer config from qual branch
  - used 100% aligned rectilinear infill @ 0 degrees to get linear lines only (see config)
- plate parts as desired
- gcode exported for eahc bed temp ranging from 20 to 60C in ten deg increments (20-40 recommended)
- export gcode to branch repo
- print

* Observations
- 
* Conclusion
- print failed due to lack of adhesion, possible stemming from using the lower recommended bound of both nozzle temps and bed temps (from manufacturer).

* Next
- branch using max recommended bed temp
- branch using amx recommended nozzle temp
